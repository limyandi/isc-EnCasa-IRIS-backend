# Project Title

EnCasa (Logistics Community Project) Built with InterSystems IRIS

### Prerequisites

```
1. InterSystems Studio (https://download.intersystems.com/download/login.csp)
```

## Getting Started

1. To Deploy the project, open `InterSystems Studio` and import both cloned XML files by navigating to `Tools->Import Local`. N.B. Create one namespace for each cloned XML data.
2. Go to IRIS Management Portal and create a new Web Application `System Administration=>Security=>Applications=>Web Applications=>Create New Web Applications`. Call it '/logistics' (choose the namespace that you used to import 'EnCasa-Dev.xml' file), and for the enable section, choose REST Radio Button and Put in REST.Logistics.disp as the dispatch class (keep all of the rest options).
3. Create another web application, call it '/fileserver', (choose the namespace that you used to import the 'EnCasa-FileServer.xml' file), and for the enable section, choose REST Radio Button and Put in Fileserver.Broker as the dispatch class (keep all of the rest options). Then, go to IRIS Terminal, set a new Global.

```
Set ^Settings("user_files_dir") = "YOUR DIRECTORY"
Important Note: This directory has to exist i.e. "C:\Users\{YourUserName}\Desktop\", to save the uploaded delivery slip to desktop.
```

4. Populate all the new Communities with the following POST Request:
{{YOUR_IRIS_INSTANCE_SERVER}}/logistics/communities
The Body Request: [communities.json](communities.json)

OPTIONAL:
To Use the Email Utility, you will have to go to IRIS management portal and set up the credentials.


5. Once you are in Management Portal, navigate to `Interoperability=>Configure=>Production`. Or, if nothing exists, navigate to `Interoperability=>List=>Productions` and choose Logistics.CommunityLogisticsProject and open it. 
6. You should see the SendEmailNotification below Operations section, click that, and go to settings. 
7. Enable the settings, and then fill in:
```
SMTP Server: smtp.gmail.com
SMTP Port: 465
Credentials: {Create your own Credentials with your GMAIL account} (Navigate to "Interoperability=>Configure=>Credentials")
```
8. Create a SSL Configuration, name it anything. (Go back to Management Portal Homepage, Navigate to `System Administration=>Security=>SSL/TLS Configurations`. Test it (on the top left corner beside cancel button), putting in:
```
Server Host Name: smtp.gmail.com
Server Port: 465
```
9. In the Additional Configuration, change 'From' to the same gmail account's email that you use in step 7.

### Testing

```
